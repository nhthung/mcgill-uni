Overhead the albatross hangs motionless upon the air
And deep beneath the rolling waves in labyrinth of coral caves
The echo of a distant tide comes willowing across the sand
And everything is green and submarine

And no one showed us to the land
And no one knows the wheres or whys
But something stirs and something tries
And starts to crawl towards the light
