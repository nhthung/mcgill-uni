Overhead the albatross hangs motionless upon the air
And deep beneath the rollins waves in labyrinth of coral caves
The echo of a distant tide comes willowing across the sand
And everything is green and submarine

Strangers passing in the streets by chance two separate closets meet
And I am you and what I see is me
And do I take you by the hand and lead you through the land
And help me understand the best I can
