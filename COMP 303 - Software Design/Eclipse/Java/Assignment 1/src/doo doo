Company ABC wants the software to track employee work hours and produce
employee widget production statistics, nothing more.

If they are constructing more than one widget there is an optional place to enter
the number of widgets created, otherwise it assumes one widget. After they finish building a
widget, they place the finished widget in the shipping room and punch out.

The system records
the amount of time it took them to create those n widgets, saving that into a database as a
punch transaction (containing punch-in time, punch-out time, quantity of widgets, and
employee ID).

If they plan to build another widget from raw material, they then get additional
raw material and they punch in again.

At the end of the day the manager generates a report of
the number of widgets created for a period by employee (widget production history). The
manager must also enter their ID number, which is also validated by the system, before they
can use it.

By default, the system assumes the current date but optionally the manager can
specify a date range. The report lists each employee and the quantity of widgets they built
within the specified period.
