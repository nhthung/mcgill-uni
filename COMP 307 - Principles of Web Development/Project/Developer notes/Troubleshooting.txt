Troubleshooting:
/opt/python - Root of where you application will end up.
/opt/python/current/app - The current application that is hosted in the environment.
/opt/python/ondeck/app - The app is initially put in on-deck and then, after all the deployment is complete, it will be moved to current. If you are getting failures in your container_commands, check out out the on-deck folder and not the current folder.
/opt/python/current/env - All the env variables that eb will set up for you. If you are trying to reproduce an error, you may first need to source /opt/python/current/env to get things set up as they would be when eb deploy is running.
opt/python/run/venv - The virtual env used by your application; you will also need to run source /opt/python/run/venv/bin/activate if you are trying to reproduce an error
